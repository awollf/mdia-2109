    <h2 class="section-header">Difficulties Last Semester:</h2>
    <p class="section-content">Last semester I struggled with memorizing the different tag options and understanding when to use what. 
        <br>We also barely went over bootstrap. I'm not sure if we will need to know that for this class, but if we do
        <br>I will need review because I'm not sure how it works. I also struggled a lot with the terminal and github.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle">A list of everything I'd like to review:</h3>
    <ul class="review-list">
        <li>When to use certain tags</li>
        <li>Media Queries</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
        <li>Z-Index</li>
        <li>CSS positions/Flex-box</li>
        <li>Grid</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-header">Learning Plan Goals:</h2>
    <p class="section-content">I want to get more comfortable with creating basic HTML documents. I would like to be confident in my abilities 
    <br>to create a basic foundational HTML file without needing to look up the correct tags to use. I'm understanding Git a 
    <br>lot more already, but I would like to be able to easily navigate the platform and terminal by the end of this year. </p>
    
        <h3>Three ways I will achive my goals:</h3>

    <ol class="goals-list">
        <li>Spend an hour each week to study tags and learn the website reactions to types of code.</li>
        <li>Use a cheat sheet to memorize codes. Help me move faster in terminal and memorize Git pushes.</li>
        <li>Continually challenge my knowledge and steps I'm taking to make sure I know what I am doing/why I am doing it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 class="checkpoint">Checkpoint: I will memorize half of the basic tags and I will be less scared when creating an HTML doc.</h4>
    <em class="side-note">Get an HTML tutor if I am still feeling behind or am struggling understanding.</em>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle">Final Goal: I will know what most of the basic tags do, and I will be confident in creating a basic HTML file.</h3>
