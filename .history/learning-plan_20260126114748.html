    <h1>My learning Plan!</h1>

    <h2>Difficulties Last Semester:</h2>
    <p>Last semester I struggled with memorizing the different tag options and understanding when to use what. 
        I struggled with being able to write media queries and making a site's width dynamic. 
        We also barely went over bootstrap. I'm not sure if we will need to know that for this class, but if we do
        I will need review because I'm not sure how it works. 
    </p>

    <h3>A list of other things I'd like to review:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>z-index</li>
        <li>CSS positions/Flex-box</li>
        <li>grid</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning Plan Goals:</h2>
    <p>I want to get more comfortable with creating basic HTML documents. I would like to be confident in my abilities 
        to create a basic foundational HTML file without needing to look up which are the correct tags to use. </p>
