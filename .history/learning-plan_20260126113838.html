    <h1>My learning Plan!</h1>

    <h2>Difficulties Last Semester</h2>
    <p>Last semester I struggled with memorizing the different tag options, and understanding when to use what. </p>

    <h2>Learning plan goals</h2>
    <p>I want to get more comfortable with creating basic HTML documents. I would like to be confident in my abilities 
        to create a basic foundational HTML file without needing to look up which are the correct tags to use. </p>
